Style Guides
===================

This project is a collaborative curation of existing guides, primarily from [Google][google]
or [Richard Lit][lit].  Please feel free to contribute.

Every major open-source project has its own style guide: a set of conventions
(sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project. It is much
easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a
consistent style.

“Style” covers a lot of ground, from “use camelCase for variable names” to
“never use global variables” to “never use exceptions.”

This project holds the [Objective-C Style Guide][objc], [Python Style Guide][py],
[R Style Guide][r], [Shell Style Guide][sh], [HTML/CSS Style Guide][htmlcss],
[JavaScript Style Guide][js].

If your project requires that you create a new XML document format, the [XML
Document Format Style Guide][xml] may be helpful. In addition to actual style
rules, it also contains advice on designing your own vs. adapting an existing
format, on XML instance document formatting, and on elements vs. attributes.
